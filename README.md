# The-Shadow-of-the-Family
This study provides new evidence on how historical patterns of household formation
shape the present-day level of trust. We test two distinct features of historical family
arrangements that might be harmful for trust towards out-groups: (a) family
extendedness in terms of the number of household members, and (b) generational
hierarchy and gender relations within the household. To conduct our study, we
collected a historical database containing 24 indicators that reflect family structure and
socioeconomic development, mostly in the 19th century. The analysis was performed
on a sample of 94 historical sub-national units within eight contemporary West and
East European countries that participated in the Life in Transition Survey in 2010. We
find that cohabitation of several generations within the historical family and power of
older generations over younger are detrimental for out-group trust today. In contrast,
family extendedness per se was revealed to have no impact on trust.
